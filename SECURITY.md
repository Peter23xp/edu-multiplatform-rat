# Security Policy

This is an educational project designed to teach cybersecurity concepts. While we've designed it to be as safe as possible for educational use, security is an important concern for any software that involves remote access capabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed.
2. Email details of the vulnerability to [projectmaintainer@example.com].
3. Include the following in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any suggested fixes if available

## Security Considerations for Users

When using this educational tool:

1. **Never** run the client on a system without explicit permission from the owner
2. Use strong authentication credentials and change the defaults
3. Do not expose the server to the internet - use it in controlled environments only
4. Regularly update the software to get the latest security patches
5. Consider running the software in a sandboxed environment

## Educational Context

Remember that this project is explicitly designed for educational purposes in cybersecurity training. The code is deliberately transparent (not obfuscated) to facilitate learning about both how similar tools work and how to defend against them.

Any features that could have security implications are documented with appropriate warnings and educational information about mitigation strategies.
